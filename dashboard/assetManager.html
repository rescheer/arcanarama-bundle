    <!--
        This panel will handle viewing, adding, and removing assets such as utilityItem objects and their linked nodeCG assets.

        There will be tabs for the different object types, and within each tab will be dynamically loaded lists of said objects with edit/remove controls for each.

        To save space, the form for entering or editing properties for an object will be held in a nodeCG Dialog.
